# Prediction-of-breast-cancer-recurrence
Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women around the world. The is one of leading cause of cancer-related death is breast cancer. We started our 
research with the Wisconsin Prognostic Breast Cancer(WPBC) dataset but the smaller size(198 rows) restricted us from exploring the true potential of our problem statement thus we moved to SEER incidence
data. With our work we aim to find recurrence of breast cancer in women using machine learning algorithms. In medical data, machine learning excels at coping with a large number of
complex higher-order interactions. As a result, machine learning and data mining approaches have a lot of promise for usage as leading health informatics tools in everyday medical practice.
The purpose of this project is to see how effective machine learning algorithms were at predicting breast cancer recurrence and forecasting.
